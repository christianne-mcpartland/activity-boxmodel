    <h1>The Benefit of Coffee</h1>
    
    <p>Coffee is a hug in a cup, and can be beneficial to your health.</p>
    
    <p>Coffee doesn't just keep you awake, it may literally make you <strong>smarter</strong> as well. The active ingredient in coffee is caffeine, which is a stimulant and the most commonly consumed <em>psychoactive substance</em> in the world. Caffeine's primary mechanism in the brain is blocking the effects of an inhibitory neurotransmitter called <em>Adenosine</em>. By blocking the inhibitory effects of <em>Adenosine</em>, caffeine actually increases neuronal firing in the brain and the release of other neurotransmitters like <em>dopamine</em> and <em>norepinephrine</em>. Many controlled trials have examined the effects of caffeine on the brain, demonstrating that caffeine can improve mood, reaction time, memory, vigilance and general cognitive function.</p>

        <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Caffeine potently blocks an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, leading to a net stimulant effect. Controlled trials show that caffeine improves both mood and brain function.</p>
